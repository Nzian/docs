Overview
********

BEdita is a tool to handle the data of your mobile, IoT, web and desktop applications.

It's a full fledged content management solution with:
 * an HTTP REST driven server application - aka REST backend - with a complete API to model, create, modify and retrieve data
 * a default progressive web application - aka Manager - to control & manage your data
 * tools to create applications upon its HTTP API

BEdita is built with `CakePHP 3 <http://cakephp.org>`_ and uses relational DBMS like `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com>`_,
`Postgres <https://www.postgresql.org>`_ or `SQLite <http://sqlite.com>`_
in conjunction with (optional) NoSQL systems like `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_, `Elastic Search <https://www.elastic.co/>`_ and `InfluxDb <https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/>`_ to boost
performance and scale up to Big Data scenarios.

`JSON-API <http://jsonapi.org>`_ is the primary, although not unique, exchange data format.
